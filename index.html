          blessing. Your friendship is more valuable than all the treasures in
          the universe. I could never have imagined how you could have touched
          my heart in so many different ways, and I will always cherish our
          friendship with everything I have in me. I adore you, my partnear

        <p>
          I miss you when something good happens to me, and you aren’t there to
          share the moment. I miss when someone misunderstands me because you
          are the one who understands me the most. I miss you when I cry or
          laugh because you wipe my tears and make me laugh even more. I miss
          you always, but I miss you the most when I am alone, and I think about
          you the times we have spent with one another because vo bhi kya din the 
          school ke ham kaise tum kaise sb kuchh jaise imposible lagata .

          like you is a rare diamond I dearly value. Love you, buddy❤️ partnear. Words just
